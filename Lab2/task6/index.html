            "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.<br> 
            The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who<br>
            comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows<br>
            great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,<br>
            and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither<br>
            know victory nor defeat."<br>
